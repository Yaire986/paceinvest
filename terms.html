        <h2>3. Earnings and Payouts</h2>
        <p>Earnings are generated from the usage fees of the charging Port. The Investor is entitled to a share of the net profits, calculated after deducting operational costs, transaction fees, and maintenance reserves. Payouts will be made on a monthly basis to the Investor's designated account.</p>
